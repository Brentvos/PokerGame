# PokerGame
A project in our second year of Game Development. We were given 1000 set of games and had to let the PC calculate the results up to Three of a Kind.

In order to get working output you should follow the following steps:

1. Download PokerGame
2. Open the Poker.sln file in Visual Studio (haven't tested it with other software)
3. Go to WriteToDisk.cs and make your own path.
