# PokerGame

A project in our second year of Game Development. We were given 1000 sets of 2 different "hands" with cards and had to let the PC calculate which one of these hands had the higher result. Calculating High Card, One Pair, Two Pair and Three of a Kind.

In order to get working output you should follow the following steps:

1. Download PokerGame
2. Open the Poker.sln file in Visual Studio (haven't tested it with other software)
3. Go to WriteToDisk.cs and make your own path.

I don't know why you would want to use this, but have fun with it if it serves you any purpose at all.
